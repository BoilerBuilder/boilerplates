## 1. Introduction

The v2 of our project introduces a highly modular and flexible template system for generating boilerplates. This system allows developers to quickly set up projects with various configurations, frameworks, and tools, while maintaining consistency and best practices across different project types.

### Key Features:
- Modular architecture with a config-based approach
- Support for multiple base projects, frameworks, and languages
- Flexible integration of additional tools and configurations
- Improved dependency management
- Enhanced boilerplate generation process

## 2. Project Structure

The new project structure is organized around a `config` folder, which contains all the necessary modules and templates for generating boilerplates. Here's an overview of the main directories:

```
config/
├── base/
│   ├── next/
│   └── vite/
│       ├── lib/
│       └── spa/
├── frameworks/
│   ├── react/
│   └── vue/
├── languages/
│   ├── javascript/
│   └── typescript/
├── tools/
│   ├── eslint/
│   ├── prettier/
│   ├── stylelint/
│   ├── vitest/
│   ├── husky/
│   ├── postcss/
│   └── sass/
└── common/
```

Each subdirectory contains a `template` folder with the necessary files and a `package.json` with the required dependencies.

## 3. Base Projects

We support the following base projects:

### 3.1 Next.js
- Server-side rendering (SSR) capable
- Ideal for complex web applications and SEO-critical projects

### 3.2 Vite
- Fast, modern build tool
- Two variants:
  - Library: For creating reusable component libraries or JavaScript/TypeScript packages
  - SPA (Single Page Application): For client-side rendered web applications

Each base project has its own `package.json` and template files, ensuring a solid foundation for the generated projects.

## 4. Frameworks

For Vite projects, we support two major frameworks:

### 4.1 React
- Popular for building user interfaces
- Extensive ecosystem and community support

### 4.2 Vue
- Progressive framework for building UIs
- Known for its simplicity and flexibility

Each framework has separate configurations for library and SPA projects, allowing for optimized setups based on the project type.

## 5. Languages

We support two primary languages:

### 5.1 JavaScript
- Widely used, versatile language for web development

### 5.2 TypeScript
- Superset of JavaScript with static typing
- Enhances code quality and developer experience

Language-specific configurations and dependencies are managed in their respective directories.

## 6. Additional Tools

Our system supports various additional tools that can be integrated into any project:

- ESLint: For code linting
- Prettier: For code formatting
- Stylelint: For CSS/SCSS linting
- Vitest: For unit and integration testing
- Husky: For managing Git hooks
- PostCSS: For transforming CSS with JavaScript
- Sass: For advanced CSS preprocessing

Each tool has its own directory with necessary configurations and dependencies.

## 7. Configuration System

The heart of our new system is the `boilerplate-config.json` file, which defines the structure and options for all available modules. This file is used by the boilerplate generation script to understand the project structure and available options.

Key aspects of the configuration system:
- Defines paths for templates and package.json files
- Specifies available options for base projects, frameworks, languages, and tools
- Allows for easy addition of new modules or modification of existing ones

## 8. Boilerplate Generation Process

The boilerplate generation process has been significantly improved in v2:

1. User selects desired options (base project, framework, language, additional tools)
2. The script validates the existence of all necessary resources
3. It then merges the package.json files from all selected modules
4. Template files are copied from the selected modules to the new project directory
5. A final package.json is generated with all necessary dependencies and scripts

This process ensures that each generated project is tailored to the specific needs of the developer while maintaining consistency with our best practices.

## 9. Dependency Management

We've implemented a sophisticated dependency management system:

- Each module (base project, framework, language, tool) has its own package.json
- Dependencies are merged during the boilerplate generation process
- This approach allows for easy updates and maintenance of dependencies for each module independently
- Conflicts are resolved by giving priority to more specific modules (e.g., tool-specific dependencies override base project dependencies)

## 10. Testing and Quality Assurance

To ensure the reliability of our boilerplate generation system:

- Comprehensive unit tests for each module and the generation script
- Integration tests that generate projects with various configurations
- Automated testing of generated projects to ensure they build and run correctly
- Regular audits of dependencies for security vulnerabilities

## 11. Continuous Integration and Deployment

We use a robust CI/CD pipeline to maintain the quality and reliability of our system:

- Automated tests run on every pull request
- Linting and code style checks are performed automatically
- Generated projects are tested on multiple Node.js versions and operating systems
- Automated deployment process for releasing new versions of the boilerplate generator

## 12. Future Improvements and Roadmap

Planned improvements for future versions:

- Support for additional frameworks (e.g., Svelte, Angular)
- Integration with more build tools and bundlers
- Enhanced customization options for generated projects
- Improved documentation generation for created projects
- Support for microservices and serverless architectures

## 13. Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the community. Here's how you can contribute:

- Reporting bugs and suggesting features through issues
- Submitting pull requests for bug fixes and new features
- Improving documentation and adding examples
- Sharing your experience and suggesting improvements

Please refer to our CONTRIBUTING.md file for detailed guidelines on how to contribute.

## 14. Troubleshooting and FAQs

This section provides solutions to common issues and answers to frequently asked questions:

- How to resolve common errors during project generation
- Tips for customizing generated projects
- How to update dependencies for a specific module
- Guidelines for adding new tools or frameworks to the system
